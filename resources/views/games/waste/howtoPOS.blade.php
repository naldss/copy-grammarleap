    <h1>How to Play POS Hunter?</h1>
    <p>
        In POS Hunter, your mission is to identify and sort words into their correct parts of speech (POS) categories.
        You’ll be presented with a series of words, and your task is to drag and drop each word into the correct box.
        Each box represents a specific part of speech, including noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition,
        conjunction, and interjection. As you place words in the correct boxes, your accuracy will be evaluated, and
        you’ll earn points based on how well you classify each word. Be quick and accurate to master the game and become
        an Elite POS Hunter!
